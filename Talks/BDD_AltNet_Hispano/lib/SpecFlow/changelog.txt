1.3.0 - 2010/05/05

New features:
+ Using standard Gherkin parser (http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/gherkin) v1.0.24
+ Context injection in step definitions. Step definitions can get a context injected with
  constructor injection. (Issue 30)
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/ContextInjection
+ Using steps in other assemblies. This enables writing steps in VB. (Issue 19)
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/ExternalSteps
+ Steps can be invoked from other steps using step text. See examples in
  Tests/FeatureTests/CallingStepsFromStepDefinitions
+ Custom step parameter converters can be defined as a binding.
  See examples in Tests/FeatureTests/StepArgumentTransfomation
+ SpecFlow feature files can be added also to VB.NET projects
+ Support for xUnit
+ Single installer for Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 (Issue 6, 10, 11)
+ Place GeneratedCodeAttribute and 'Designer generated code' region on generated code to
  avoid having this code parsed by code analysis. (Issue 33)
+ Configuration option to disable all output. (Issue 29)
  Use the following config to disable output:
  <trace listener="TechTalk.SpecFlow.Tracing.NullListener, TechTalk.SpecFlow" />

Fixed issues:
+ SpecFlow Reporting doesn't work with Firefox (Issue 31)
+ Binding methods are executed using the culture of the feature file.
+ Several parsing issues are solved now (Issue 1, 8, 9, 37)
